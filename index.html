        <p>Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
            I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
            Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
            But I hope I never see them againI know it breaks your heart
            Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
            Four years, no calls
            Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
            I-I-I can't stop
            No, I-I-I can't stop </p>
